# Darth_Vader_recognition
This project is retraining the Google Inception model to recognize Darth_Vader. However, it can also be used to retrain the model to recognize other things in a image. The project was inspired by Siraj Raval, and you can see the original work through [this link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfNvhPx5Px8).
